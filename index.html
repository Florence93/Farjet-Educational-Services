             reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been
              acquired over a long period of learning. The content of the GRE consists of
               certain specific algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. 
               The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at 
               testing centers and institution owned or authorized by Prometric. In the 
               graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed 
               upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and departments within 
               schools.  </p>

                 According to the test-owning company, the Graduate Management Admission
                  Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving
                   abilities while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical 
                   reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business 
                   and management success.[5] It can be taken up to five times a year but
                    no more than eight times total. Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.
